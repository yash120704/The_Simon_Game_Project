# 🎮 Simon Game

This is a web-based version of the classic **Simon Game**, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to **remember and repeat** an ever-increasing sequence of colors. Each level adds a new color to the pattern. If you click the wrong color, the game ends and you can start again.

## 🧠 How to Play

1. Press any key to start the game.
2. Watch the color sequence that blinks.
3. Click the buttons in the same order.
4. With each correct round, the sequence gets longer.
5. If you click the wrong button, the game ends — but you can restart by pressing any key.
